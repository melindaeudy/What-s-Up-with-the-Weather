# What's the Weather Like?

## Background
Start with Weather API and a random list of cities to research their relationship of Latitude to temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.

* Use Jupyter notebook, Matplotlib, Pandas

* Create scatterplots and run liner regress on the relationships.

* Next, reduce the list of cities to ideal vacation spots based on temperature between 70 and 80 degrees, wind speed less than 10 mph and zero cloudiness.

* Finally locate a hotel in the city within 5000 meters of the city and plot it on a heatmap.

## Data Used
Used OpenWatherMap Api and Google Maps Platform to create the data for the cities and analyze.

Observable Trends:
* The closer the city is to the equator the warmer the temperature.

* Heatmap with pins locating the hotels in the Ideal locations
