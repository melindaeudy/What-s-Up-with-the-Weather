# What's the Weather Like?

## Background
Start with Weather API and a random list of cities to research their relationship of Latitude to temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.  

Create scatterplots and run liner regress on the relationships.

Next, reduce the list of cities to ideal vacation spots based on temperature between 70 and 80 degrees, wind speed less than 10 mph and zero cloudiness.  

Finally locate a hotel in the city within 5000 meters of the city and plot it on a heatmap.   

Use Jupyter notebook, Matplotlib, Pandas

## Data Used
Used OpenWatherMap Api and Google Maps Platform to create the data for the cities and analyze.

Observable Trends:
1.	The closer the city is to the equator the warmer the temperature.
